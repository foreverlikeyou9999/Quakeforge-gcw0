o = todo
X = done
? = maybe but not likely
M = more testing
I = in progress
W = waiting on other work

X	fix object files
M	arrays in structures
M	unnamed function parameters for prototypes/typdefs etc.
I	optimizations (esp CSE)
I	fix used/uninitialized warnings
o	id id;
o	vec = [x, y, z]; expressions (nice feature in fteqcc)
o	fix enums in switch statements (use tables (treat as int), check missing)
o	arrays in entities
o	optional arguments for functions (alternative to overloading)
	vector(vector fwd, optional vector up) vectoangles = #51;
?	try to reduce memory consumption
??	embedded nul characters in strings (why?)
??	"":"" string concatenation (parser issues) (why?)
